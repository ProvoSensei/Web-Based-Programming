# Web-Based-Programming
This is my project to fullfil my final semester assignment for courses Web Based Programming in second semester. I use PHP, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

My web is called INSIST meaning Informasi Seputar Mahasiswa Telkom University. Insist is a forum student of Telkom University to exchange their information or search some information in Telkom Unviersity.
